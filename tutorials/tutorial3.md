## How to create a list

In this tutorial we're going to learn what is/how to create a list.
A list is used to store multiple variables in one.
So how do we create a list? Let me show you!

```python
my_list = ["Grapes", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Bluebarries"]
```
 We can print out the list in two ways:
```python
my_list = ["Grapes", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Bluebarries"]
for items in my_list: #This will go through the list
  print(items)
#Or
print(my_list)
```
