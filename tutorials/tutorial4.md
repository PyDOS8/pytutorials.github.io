## Tutorial 4: Conditions

* Types of conditions

== : This means equals to.

!= : This means not equal to(you can also say is not)

if : This is for decision making. (This is not a condition)

< : Less then

> : Greater then
For example,
```python
x = 4
if x < 5:
 print(x)
if x > 4:
 print("X is more than 4!")
if x == 4:
   print("X is equal to 4!")
```
